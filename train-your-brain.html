                Exercise game for Alzheimer's patients
                By urging the patients to make quick responses, they can improve their judgement skills. The data
                collected in this game can be used to study patterns and detect patients and give them the required
                treatment early.

            <p>Train your brain was a hackathon project that focused on the problems in the healthcare sector.</p>
            <p>Through this project, we address the issue of Alzheimer's disease and pitch a game that can help with
                improving patient outlook on cognitive exercises.</p>
